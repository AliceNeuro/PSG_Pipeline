    "# Processing PSG XML Files for Arousal Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook processes PSG (Polysomnography) XML files to extract arousal events and calculate arousal burden metrics across different sleep stages.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis pipeline consists of four main components:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Data Extraction\n",
    "- **XML Parsing**: Read PSG XML files using ElementTree parser\n",
    "- **Event Extraction**: Extract arousal events with timestamps, durations, and event labels\n",
    "- **Sleep Stage Mapping**: Extract sleep stage sequences for each epoch (default 30-second epochs)\n",
    "- **Stage Code Mapping**: Map sleep stage names (N1, N2, N3, REM, Wake, Unscorable) to numeric codes\n",
    "- **Error Handling**: Handle missing or malformed data gracefully with error logging\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Data Validation and Filtering\n",
    "- **Duration Filtering**: Remove arousal events with duration ≤ 0 seconds\n",
    "- **Sleep-Time Focus**: Filter arousals to only include those occurring during sleep stages (N1, N2, N3, REM)\n",
    "- **Wake Exclusion**: Exclude arousals during Wake (0) and Unscorable (9) epochs\n",
    "- **Data Validation**: Check for missing required fields (event name, start time, duration)\n",
    "- **Overlap Handling**: Merge overlapping arousal events into singular events to avoid double-counting\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Arousal Burden Calculation\n",
    "- **Proportional Allocation**: Use proportional allocation to determine arousal time within each sleep stage\n",
    "- **Multi-Epoch Spanning**: For arousals spanning multiple epochs, calculate overlap with each stage epoch\n",
    "- **Interval Merging**: Merge overlapping arousal intervals to prevent double-counting\n",
    "- **Sleep Time Calculation**: Calculate total sleep time per stage (epoch_length × number_of_epochs_in_stage)\n",
    "- **Burden Formula**: Compute arousal burden as: `(total_arousal_duration_in_stage / total_stage_duration) × 100`\n",
    "- **Edge Case Handling**: Handle cases where sleep stages have zero duration (return None for burden)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Statistical Analysis and Export\n",
    "- **Batch Processing**: Process all XML files in the `/psg/` folder\n",
    "- **Summary Generation**: Generate per-file summary with total sleep time, total arousal duration, and stage-specific burdens\n",
    "- **CSV Export**: Export results to CSV file for further analysis\n",
    "- **Statistical Overview**: Display sample results and descriptive statistics across all processed files\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Metrics Calculated\n",
    "- **Total Arousal Duration**: Sum of all arousal event durations during sleep (minutes)\n",
    "- **Total Sleep Time**: Total time spent in sleep stages N1, N2, N3, and REM (minutes)\n",
    "- **Overall Arousal Burden**: Percentage of sleep time occupied by arousal events\n",
    "- **Stage-Specific Arousal Burden**: Arousal burden calculated separately for N1, N2, N3, and REM stages"
